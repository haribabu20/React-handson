4. Demonstrate the difference between state and props with a practical example.


âœ… The state (count) is managed inside the Parent Component (CounterApp).
âœ… The child component (CounterDisplay) receives the count as a prop and cannot modify it directly.
âœ… Clicking the buttons in the parent updates the state, which re-renders both components.



Key Takeaways
State is mutable and belongs to the component that defines it.
Props are immutable and used to pass data from parent to child.
ðŸ’¡ This example helps visualize how state (dynamic data) flows from parent to child via props. ðŸš€
