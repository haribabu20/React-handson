3. Create a parent component that passes data to a child component using props. The child component should display the data and have a button to update the data in the parent component.


Here in Child we have input box and a button. When we type any text, that will be captured in one variable and we'll have to pass that when we click the button to parent. 
Parent on the other hand will shoot that variable with additional text as welcome. So if you type "Hari" in child, then in parent you'd get Welcome hari
